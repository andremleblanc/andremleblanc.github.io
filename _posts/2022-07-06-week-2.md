We went to the Keys this weekend for a really quick trip. Left on Friday (I worked in the car while Charity drove), stayed Saturday, and came back Sunday; but even in that quick, hectic trip it made me miss the water and some of the fun times from living on the boat.

I love taking trips like that because it really helps me to refocus on what's important.

## Something I'm Reading
I'm still listening to Rich Dad Poor Dad, mostly while I stretch my neck on the Denneroll. The first lesson in the book is "Don't work for money, let money work for you". I think this is a really poignant thought and certainly something to work towards. While I do want to contribute value to the world and don't really plan on ever not working, I'd rather do so on my own terms and on something I'm completely passionate about. "Letting money work for you" is the road to get there. I really believe that *everyone* needs to know how to invest. I shared this lesson with my kids.
