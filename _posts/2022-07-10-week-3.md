## Something I'm Reading
I'm still listening to Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but this week I made a point to make some notes. A couple of nuggets that really stuck with me are:

- Decisiveness: Itâ€™s the edge in a competitive world.

  I often struggle with "analysis paralysis" and while it is useful to think through a situation, taking too long can cause missing out on situations or make things take longer than they should.

- Change what you can, you have control over yourself.

  This reminds me a lot of growth mindset vs fixed mindset; it's something that really resonates for me. I think it's better to err on the side of taking too much responsibility for things that don't go well or things you dislike so that you shift your mindset into working to overcome them.


## Something I Photographed
I got nothing this week.

## Something I'm Excited About
I've been looking into getting back on the water and I think I'm going to start with some on-water powerboat instruction so that I'm more comfortable to rent a boat through Boatsetter.
