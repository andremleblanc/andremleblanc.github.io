## Something I'm Reading
I've just started listening to _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ because I've heard it reference by so many people in the Real Estate Investing space that I figured I should. I'm also rereading _Practical Object Oriented Desing in Ruby_ by Sandi Metz because each time I read it I get more out of it.

## Something I Photographed
I took time to print out some polaroids of a handful of my favorite memories so that I can visually remind myself everyday of why I'm working.

## Something I'm Excited About
I'm really excited about an app I'm working on slowly in my freetime. It's really just a hobby, but I hope to show it to a few people soon and see if they find it valuable.
